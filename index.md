# Phone-Controlled Robot Arm

The project I chose was to build and operate a robot arm using an Arduino and servo motors. The goal is to be able to control the arm through Bluetooth using a mobile app.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Arduino Uno with some servos and a Bluetooth reciever. I first started with connecting my Arduino board with another board called the Arduino Sensor Shield v5, the sensor shield on top of the arduino. This will allow me to connect multiple servos at once very easily. I connected one servo to the sensor shield board and connected my Arduino to my computer to make sure my servo worked properly. I wrote a simple program to rotate a servo back and forth to test its range of motion and to learn a bit more about coding with servo motors. An issues I ran into was from getting an error "Compilationerror: error 13 INTERNAL", which came from not having the servo library installed.
